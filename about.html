                  <p style="text-align:center">Born on February 17th, 2000 in Fairfax, VA, Mason Cook has dedicated his life to the pursuit of greatness.
                      The son of two musically-inclined government employees, Mason was surrounded by the world and music throughout his childhood, which fueled his desire to contribute to it.
                          A multitude of chance encounters would enable him to fulfill this desire.
                      From a young age Mason joined the other members of his family for their various rehearsals and performances. He loved the vibrant atmosphere of the musical world, and soon he began going to rehearsals of his own. Starting in 5th grade Mason began playing percussion,
                      first for White Oaks Elementary School (where he made the Lake Braddock District Band), before proceeding to Robinson Secondary School, where he was a member of the Robinson Symphonic Band, Philharmonic Orchestra, and Marching Rams. Mason's music career would take a fateful turn in 9th grade
                      after he was caught improvising a bell part he never received, thus Mason was sent home with the score and the assignment of manually extracting the bell part from it.
                      While he was doing this he began messing around with his newly downloaded notation software and wrote a random measure which, much to his surprise, he loved the sound of. What had started as a makeshift punishment had birthed Mason's interest in music composition.
                      One day while hanging out with a friend from his hockey team he was introduced to Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii and instantly feel in love with the game and the series. His interest in the series continued to grow
