       <h1 style="text-align:center">ABOUT</h1>
                  <p style="text-align:center">Born on February 17th, 2000 in Fairfax, VA, Mason Cook has dedicated his life to the pursuit of greatness. <br>
                      The son of two musically-inclined government employees, Mason was surrounded by the world and music throughout his childhood, which fueled his desire to contribute to it.
                          A multitude of chance encounters would enable him to fulfill this desire.
                      From a young age Mason joined the other members of his family for their various rehearsals and performances. He loved the vibrant atmosphere of the musical world, and soon he began going to rehearsals of his own. Starting in 5th grade Mason began playing percussion,
                      first for White Oaks Elementary School (where he made the Lake Braddock District Band), before proceeding to Robinson Secondary School, where he was a member of the Robinson Symphonic Band, Philharmonic Orchestra, and Marching Rams. Mason's music career would take a fateful turn in 9th grade
                      after he was caught improvising a bell part he never received, thus Mason was sent home with the score and the assignment of manually extracting the bell part from it.
                      While he was doing this he began messing around with his newly downloaded notation software and wrote a random measure which, much to his surprise, he loved the sound of. What had started as a makeshift punishment had birthed Mason's interest in music composition.
                      From this point forward Mason began seriously composing, and he has written a variety of works for ensembles of all sizes and skill levels. He currently goes to Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA, where he majors in music composition and performs with the Occidental Philharmonic Orchestra. <br>
                      One day while hanging out with a friend from his hockey team he was introduced to Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii and instantly feel in love with the game and the series. His interest in the series continued to grow as he stumbled upon old vods from Smash's competitive scene.
                      Purchasing Smash 3DS on Day 1, he chose "6r", and eventually "THE_6r", as his tag after the ingame name his father put in an old DS poker game that Mason played frequently. While he never truly went to events for Smash 4, THE_6r watched the competitive scene closely throughout the entirety of the game's life.
                      His interest in directly competing dramatically increased with the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and he started actively going to tournaments and dramatically increased his mastery of the game.
                      He currently plays for Occidental College through OxyGG.
